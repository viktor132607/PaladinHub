<section id="rotation">
    <h2>Rotation</h2>

    <h3>Single Target Rotation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep Consecration active at all times. Recast it if you move out of it or it expires.</li>
        <li>Use Shield of the Righteous as much as possible to maintain uptime and boost armor.</li>
        <li>Use Avenger's Shield on cooldown for Holy damage, interrupts, silences, and Holy Power generation.</li>
        <li>Use Judgment on cooldown for Holy Power generation and applying debuffs (Greater Judgment if talented).</li>
        <li>Use Hammer of the Righteous or Blessed Hammer to generate Holy Power when other abilities are on cooldown.</li>
        <li>Use Word of Glory to heal yourself when needed, ideally with Shining Light procs (free cost).</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>AoE Rotation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Same as Single Target but prioritize maintaining Consecration in AoE packs.</li>
        <li>Avenger's Shield becomes even more important — it bounces and silences multiple targets.</li>
        <li>Hammer of the Righteous (or Blessed Hammer) hits multiple targets if you're standing inside Consecration.</li>
        <li>Divine Toll (if talented) is amazing for pulling and maintaining aggro — instantly throws Avenger's Shields at multiple enemies.</li>
        <li>Prioritize Shield of the Righteous uptime for armor and active mitigation during heavy AoE hits.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Cooldown Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ardent Defender - Use as a cheat death or when expecting big damage hits.</li>
        <li>Guardian of Ancient Kings - Use for very heavy incoming magic or physical damage to cut it in half.</li>
        <li>Divine Shield - Last resort cooldown, immune to all damage but causes Forbearance. Use a cancel macro if needed to avoid losing threat.</li>
        <li>Eye of Tyr - Use on cooldown for AoE damage reduction during pulls and boss fights.</li>
        <li>Avenging Wrath (or Sentinel) - Use offensively for extra damage or during burst phases to survive big pulls with increased Haste or healing.</li>
        <li>Moment of Glory (if talented) - Line up with Avenger’s Shield and big pulls for maximum damage and survivability.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Defensive Priority</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Always maintain Consecration uptime for passive mitigation from Mastery and talents.</li>
        <li>Maintain Shield of the Righteous uptime as much as possible for armor buff.</li>
        <li>Use Word of Glory when needed — save yourself before you drop to critical HP.</li>
        <li>Plan cooldowns — don't wait until you are almost dead to use Ardent Defender or Guardian of Ancient Kings.</li>
        <li>Position mobs inside Consecration and kite if necessary — especially when playing with Consecrated Ground for slows.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>Mastery - Increases your chance to block attacks and boosts your passive mitigation when standing in Consecration.</li>
        <li>Critical Strike and Versatility - Both are fine, but lower priority than Haste/Mastery. Crit adds some DPS, Versatility adds slight mitigation and extra healing taken.</li>

        <li>Use defensive trinkets that increase armor, absorb damage, or provide on-use mitigation.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, use Strength proc trinkets for added DPS during Avenging Wrath windows.</li>
        <li>Some specific strong trinkets include Bloodstained Dragon Scale, Emblem of the Brood Keeper, or similar patch-appropriate dungeon/raid drops.</li>

    <h2>Leveling</h2>

    <h3>Leveling Tips for Protection Paladin</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Focus on spamming Consecration to damage large packs of enemies efficiently. Consecration uptime is critical for both survivability and DPS while leveling.</li>
        <li>Use Shield of the Righteous whenever you have Holy Power ready. It boosts your armor massively and prevents a lot of damage, allowing for bigger pulls.</li>
        <li>Judgment should be used on cooldown to generate Holy Power and debuff targets (especially if you have Greater Judgment talented for extra spender damage).</li>
        <li>Use Hammer of the Righteous or Blessed Hammer as your filler ability when waiting for cooldowns.</li>
        <li>Keep Divine Steed handy for fast repositioning, pulling packs faster, and escaping when necessary. Pick up Cavalier talent early for two charges of Divine Steed.</li>
        <li>Dungeon leveling is highly recommended. Protection Paladin can tank multiple enemies very efficiently in dungeons, leading to fast XP and gear upgrades.</li>
        <li>While solo questing, take talents that boost your survivability and Holy Power generation early on rather than focusing only on damage talents.</li>
        <li>Make sure to maintain Consecration uptime especially when you talent into Consecrated Ground — it slows enemies standing inside and helps you kite when needed.</li>
        <li>Save Avenger's Shield and Divine Toll (if talented) for dangerous mobs or multiple targets that can overwhelm you.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to use Word of Glory to heal up between pulls, especially when you have free casts from Shining Light procs.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h3>Healing Spells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Word of Glory (WoG)</strong> - A powerful single-target heal. Heal amount increases based on how low your health is. Costs 3 Holy Power unless triggered by Shining Light.</li>
        <li><strong>Flash of Light (FoL)</strong> - A quick-casting heal. Should be avoided during active tanking as you can't block, parry, or dodge while casting. Useful during downtime or between pulls.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Defensive Spells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shield of the Righteous (SotR)</strong> - Slams enemies in front of you and significantly increases your armor based on Strength. Costs 3 Holy Power. Core defensive rotation spell.</li>
        <li><strong>Divine Shield (DS)</strong> - Makes you completely immune to all damage and debuffs for 8 seconds. Causes Forbearance. Should have a cancel macro if used while actively tanking to prevent losing threat.</li>
        <li><strong>Ardent Defender (AD)</strong> - Reduces all damage by 20% and can prevent death by restoring you to 20% health if a lethal blow lands while active.</li>
        <li><strong>Guardian of Ancient Kings (GoAK)</strong> - Reduces all damage taken by 50% for 8 seconds. Long cooldown but vital for surviving massive damage spikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye of Tyr (EoT)</strong> - Deals AoE Holy damage and reduces the damage enemies deal to you by 25% for a short time. Excellent for large pulls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Offensive Spells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Judgment (J)</strong> - A ranged Holy strike that generates 1 Holy Power and debuffs the enemy. Essential for Holy Power flow and comboing with offensive talents.</li>
        <li><strong>Avenger's Shield (AS)</strong> - Throws your shield at a target, dealing Holy damage, silencing, and interrupting. Bounces to 2 other nearby targets. Generates Holy Power and is a massive part of your damage output.</li>
        <li><strong>Hammer of Wrath (HoW)</strong> - Available against targets below 20% HP or during Avenging Wrath. A high damage ability that generates 1 Holy Power. Can be modified with talents to always be usable (through Endless Wrath proc chance).</li>
        <li><strong>Consecration (Cons)</strong> - Places a ground effect that deals periodic Holy damage and reduces incoming damage if you stand in it. Core part of both damage and mitigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Blessed Hammer / Hammer of the Righteous</strong> - Your primary filler spell. Blessed Hammer provides light AoE damage and reduces enemy attack power. Hammer of the Righteous boosts AoE damage when standing in Consecration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Utility Spells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hand of Reckoning (Taunt)</strong> - Forces a target to attack you for 3 seconds. Grants a bonus threat modifier during that window.</li>

        <li><strong>Blessing of Protection (BoP)</strong> - Makes the target immune to all physical damage for 8 seconds. Causes Forbearance. Can be used to save DPS or tanks at critical moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Blessing of Sacrifice (BoSac)</strong> - Redirects 30% of an ally's damage to yourself for 12 seconds. Ends early if you drop below 20% HP. Vital external cooldown.</li>
        <li><strong>Blessing of Freedom (BoF)</strong> - Removes movement-impairing effects and grants immunity to them for 8 seconds. Good for both yourself and party members in dungeons with heavy roots/snares.</li>

<section id="stats">
    <h2>Stats Priority</h2>

    <p>Protection Paladin stat priority in Patch 11.1 & Season 2 focuses on ensuring maximum uptime of Shield of the Righteous, strong passive mitigation, and smooth rotation flow.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength</strong> - Main stat. Increases attack power, parry chance, and overall contribution to damage and survivability. Strength is king.</li>
        <li><strong>Haste</strong> - Reduces global cooldown, lowers cooldowns on important abilities (Shield of the Righteous, Avenger’s Shield, Judgment). Ensures smooth and responsive rotation, increases Holy Power generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Mastery: Divine Bulwark</strong> - Increases block chance and grants passive damage reduction while standing in Consecration. Synergizes perfectly with Protection Paladin’s natural gameplay loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Strike</strong> - Provides moderate offensive boosts by increasing the chance for abilities to critically hit. Minor bonus for Shield of the Righteous burst damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility</strong> - Slightly boosts damage, healing, and reduces damage taken. Balanced but generally less impactful than Haste/Mastery for pure tankiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Simple Priority:</h3>
    <p><strong>Strength > Haste > Mastery > Crit = Versatility</strong></p>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always favor gear upgrades based on overall item level unless the secondary stat distribution is very bad (for example, extremely high Crit gear pieces are worse than lower Haste/Mastery pieces).</li>
        <li>Haste is still king even at higher gear levels — you want very high Haste percentages to keep Shield of the Righteous uptime consistent.</li>
        <li>Mastery stacking can be very powerful for passive tankiness, especially in raid environments where big block events matter.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="consumables">
    <h2>Consumables</h2>

    <h3>Flasks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phial of Tepid Versatility</strong> - Good balance between defensive and offensive boosts. A reliable choice for general dungeon/raid tanking.</li>
        <li><strong>Phial of Static Empowerment</strong> - For situations where you don't need to move much. Great when you’re confident on bosses with little movement requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Phial of Elemental Chaos</strong> - Random effects, can provide large Haste buffs but less predictable. Risky but high reward in DPS heavy situations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Food</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Feast Buffs</strong> - Take whatever your raid uses for Feasts; these usually give large amounts of Strength or Haste.</li>
        <li><strong>Individual Food</strong> - Choose Haste food or Mastery food if eating solo. Examples: Timely Demise (Haste) or Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak for Strength.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Potions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Elemental Potion of Power</strong> - Provides a large Strength buff. Used pre-pull or during burst phases to maximize Avenging Wrath DPS and Shield of the Righteous spam.</li>
        <li><strong>Refreshing Healing Potion</strong> - Instant heal potion. Always keep a few on you for emergencies when Word of Glory and Lay on Hands are not available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weapon Oils</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buzzing Rune</strong> - Boosts Haste. Best choice for smooth rotation and Shield of the Righteous uptime.</li>
        <li><strong>Howling Rune</strong> - Boosts Critical Strike. Not generally preferred over Buzzing Rune unless you are already capped on Haste.</li>
        <li><strong>Chirping Rune</strong> - Boosts Versatility. Good fallback for more durability at the cost of less throughput.</li>
    </ul>
