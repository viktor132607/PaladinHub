		"Overview" => "\t\t\t\t\tHoly Paladin is a plate-wearing Healer specialization with a wide range of damage reduction and defensive abilities. We specialize in healing specific targets with large single-target heals, commonly referred to as “spot healing”. Holy Paladin gets access to the iconic Beacon of Light ability at level 16, which allows us to keep a consistent stream of healing on a specific target while healing other allies who might need it!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBesides the classic Healer resource, Mana, Holy Paladins also utilize a secondary resource known as Holy Power, which functions similarly to Combo Points. Most of our spells generate this resource, which we can then use to cast our most powerful heals, Word of Glory and Light of Dawn.\r\n",
