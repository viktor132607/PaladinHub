				<p>
					<strong>Retribution Paladin</strong> are holy crusaders who use a Two-Handed weapon to turn the power of the Light into powerful damaging abilities and bring justice and vengeance to their enemies. Retribution is the damage specialization of Paladin and is a melee spec, although it has many abilities that can be cast from range as well.

					The core of our rotation is centered around using abilities like  Blade of Justice and  Judgment to generate Holy Power, which is consumed to deal potent damage with abilities like  Final Verdict or  Divine Storm. Although Paladin's mobility options are somewhat limited, you will have access to a large array of buffs for yourself and your party to help you throughout a fight, as well as strong defensive and healing capabilities for your role.

					If playing a melee DPS with strong group support and healing options, along with some powerful burst damage cooldowns, sounds appealing, then Retribution might be for you..

				<!-- Strengths and Weaknesses Section (2 Columns) -->
				<div class="content-columns">
					<!-- Left Column (Strengths) -->
					<div>
						<h2>Strengths</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Easy to learn playstyle that doesn't punish mistakes harshly.
							<li>
							<li>Many strong defensive tools, which include both passive abilities and active ones like  Divine Shield and  Divine Protection.
							<li>
							<li>Plenty of utility options that will usually find uses in any type of content.
							<li>
							<li>Strong options for both self-healing and off-healing for your group if needed.
							<li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<!-- Right Column (Weaknesses) -->
					<div>
						<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>On the low side for mobility;  Divine Steed is your main option.</li>
							<li>Utility options can be redundant in high-end content.</li>
							<li>Low skill ceiling; there's not much nuance to master once you learn the basics.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2 class="hero-talents-title">Hero Talents</h2>
				<div>

					<p>Retribution has access to two Hero Talent trees: Herald of the Sun and Templar.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="content-columns">
					<div class="hero-talent-entry">
						<img src="~/images/Herald.jpg" alt="Herald of the Sun" />
						<h2>Herald Of The Sun</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Herald of the Sun Retribution Paladins are focused on periodic damage effects, especially their signature, Dawnlight.
								These effects also trigger automatically during your cooldowns. On top of that, Herald of the Sun also features buffs to  Divine Storm and  Hammer of Wrath.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="hero-talent-entry">
						<img src="~/images/Templar.jpg" alt="Templar" />
						<h2>Templar</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Templar Retribution Paladins gain access to  Hammer of Light, a powerful Holy Power spender that you can use during your burst windows.
								You'll also rain down  Empyrean Hammers from the sky upon your enemies, which are automatically cast through different spells and buffs.
							</li>

						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>


				<p>Currently, Templar is significantly ahead on damage compared to Herald of the Sun. You can still play Herald of the Sun in most content, but the damage gap is very noticeable.</p>

				<h2>Playstyle Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Retribution Paladins use a priority system rather than a strict rotation. The important things to keep in mind in most situations are:
				<p>

				</p>Try to not waste Holy Power. This is the most important thing to remember when playing Retribution. A significant portion of our damage comes from spending our Holy Power, hence, overcapping it will reduce your damage significantly.<p>

				<p>Keep  Expurgation active and  Judgment debuffs applied to enemies. These effects significantly buff your other damage.<p>

				</p>Prioritize using Holy Power spenders when able, since many effects generate extra Holy Power that could otherwise be wasted, and using spenders procs many important effects like  Radiant Glory.<p>

						<img src="~/images/Separators/D5.png" alt="Separator 5" class="separator" />
					</div>

					<h2>Key Talents and Changes</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Infusion of Light</strong> procs are crucial for free and empowered heals.</li>
						<li><strong>Barrier of Faith</strong> remains a strong tool for focused healing targets.</li>
						<li><strong>Daybreak</strong> lets you reset your Beacon healing, adding burst power during key moments.</li>
						<li><strong>Hand of Divinity</strong> improves your healing rotation significantly.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Stat Priority</h2>
				<p><strong>Primary Stat:</strong> Intellect</p>
				<p><strong>Secondary Stats:</strong> Haste &gt; Crit &gt; Versatility &gt; Mastery</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Overall, Holy Paladin is in a very strong spot in <em>The War Within</em>. It's a top-tier option for players who enjoy a mobile, aggressive healing style with a ton of clutch playmaking potential through smart cooldown use and positioning.</p>

				<h1>Core Build - The Faithful Martyr</h1>

				<p>The Faithful Martyr is an aggressive, powerful instant cast-focused build that will usher in a new golden age for Holy Paladins in Season 2. In Mythic+, you spend Holy Power on Eternal Flame for healing and Shield of the Righteous for damage, while in raid you'll use both Eternal Flame and Light of Dawn depending on if you want AoE or spot healing.</p>

				<div class="separator-container">
					<img src="~/images/Separators/D1.png" alt="Separator 1" class="separator" />
				</div>

				<h2>Mythic+ Version</h2>
				<p>In Mythic+ you will spend Holy Power on Eternal Flame for healing and Shield of the Righteous for damage. Here is what your talent priority will look like:</p>

				<div class="build-images">

				<h2>Raid Version</h2>
				<p>In raid, this build plays very similar to Mythic+, and your beacons should similarly go on either high HPS requirement tanks like Brewmasters, or squishy ranged like hunters/evokers/mages.</p>
