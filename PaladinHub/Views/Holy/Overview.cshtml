					<h2>War Within Season 2</h2>

					<p>Holy Paladin remains a powerhouse healer in both dungeons and raids. Our strengths lie in high throughput, extremely durable survivability, and strong utility offerings. In The War Within, we're looking at a very solid toolkit with minor talent shifts but the core gameplay remains familiar and strong.</p>

					<div class="content-columns">
						<div>
							<h2>Strengths</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Very strong single-target and group healing output.</li>
								<li>Excellent defensives and personal survivability.</li>
								<li>High mobility through Divine Steed and instant casts.</li>
								<li>Powerful utility tools like Lay on Hands, Blessing of Freedom, and Cleanse.</li>
								<li>Beacon healing makes damage patterns more manageable.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Somewhat reliant on good positioning and being in melee range.</li>
								<li>Resource (Holy Power) management is important and can be punishing if neglected.</li>
								<li>Limited raid-wide cooldowns compared to some other healers.</li>
							</ul>

				<h2>Playstyle Overview</h2>
				<p>Holy Paladins focus on generating Holy Power through abilities like Holy Shock and Crusader Strike, and spending it on powerful finishers like Word of Glory or Light of Dawn. Melee uptime is key for maximizing your generation and efficiency, but you have strong ranged options when needed.</p>

				<div class="separator-container">
					<img src="~/images/Separators/D5.png" alt="Separator 5" class="separator" />
				</div>

				<h2>Holy Paladin Changes in Patch 11.1.5</h2>
				<p>Holy Paladins saw some talent reworks and minor tuning in 11.1.5, but their playstyle remains largely intact. Daybreak, Infusion, and Beacon interactions are even more emphasized, rewarding smart Holy Power management.</p>

				<div class="separator-container">
					<img src="~/images/Separators/D1.png" alt="Separator 1" class="separator" />
				</div>
				<h2>Key Talents and Changes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Infusion of Light</strong> procs are crucial for free and empowered heals.</li>
					<li><strong>Barrier of Faith</strong> remains a strong tool for focused healing targets.</li>
					<li><strong>Daybreak</strong> lets you reset your Beacon healing, adding burst power during key moments.</li>
					<li><strong>Hand of Divinity</strong> improves your healing rotation significantly.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="separator-container">
					<img src="~/images/Separators/D1.png" alt="Separator 1" class="separator" />

				<h2>Stat Priority</h2>
				<p><strong>Primary Stat:</strong> Intellect</p>
				<p><strong>Secondary Stats:</strong> Haste &gt; Crit &gt; Versatility &gt; Mastery</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Overall, Holy Paladin is in a very strong spot in <em>The War Within</em>. It's a top-tier option for players who enjoy a mobile, aggressive healing style with a ton of clutch playmaking potential through smart cooldown use and positioning.</p>

				<h1>Core Build - The Faithful Martyr</h1>
				<h2>Raiding & Mythic+ Holy Builds for The War Within Season 2</h2>

				<p>The Faithful Martyr is an aggressive, powerful instant cast-focused build that will usher in a new golden age for Holy Paladins in Season 2. In Mythic+, you spend Holy Power on Eternal Flame for healing and Shield of the Righteous for damage, while in raid you'll use both Eternal Flame and Light of Dawn depending on if you want AoE or spot healing.</p>

				<div class="separator-container">
					<img src="~/images/Separators/D1.png" alt="Separator 1" class="separator" />
				</div>

				<h2>Mythic+ Version</h2>
				<p>In Mythic+ you will spend Holy Power on Eternal Flame for healing and Shield of the Righteous for damage. Here is what your talent priority will look like:</p>

						Retribution Paladin WeakAuras, Macros & Addons - The War Within 11.2
					</h2>
					<p>WeakAuras, Macros, and Addons provide many quality-of-life improvements in WoW, allowing players to improve how information is displayed in-game or automate decision-making to optimize performance.

						In this guide, we will go over useful Retribution Paladin macros for Patch 11.2, explain how to make your own macros, and cover some of the best Retribution Paladin addons for both hardcore raiders and general players alike. Whether you're looking for specialized Retribution Paladin macros to help you gain a competitive edge or creating a custom user interface to expand your view of the game world, this page will help get you started with some of the most popular choices within the Retribution Paladin community.

						WeakAuras2 is an extremely flexible WoW addon, with near limitless creative potential and control, capable of modifying or replacing nearly any part of the user interface.

						Recommended Retribution Paladin WeakAuras
					</h3>

					<p>
						WeakAuras2 is an extremely flexible addon, with near limitless creative potential and control, capable of replicating or replacing nearly any part of the user interface. While designed as a simple way to create alerts to remind you of buffs, debuff, or encounter mechanics, it has become an integral part of World of Warcraft user interface customization, allowing players to replace their traditional action bars, create and share complex raid information, track other players spell casts, and much, much more. In this section, we've highlighted some of the best WeakAuras for Retribution Paladin, although there are so many different options available that we highly recommend visiting wago.io to find one that best suits your needs.

						General Ability Tracking
						There's plenty of options to choose from on wago.io for what style and layout you want to use to track abilities. Here's one option that will track all your major buffs and cooldowns:
						https://wago.io/OsqHM7Mf8
						Holy Power Tracking
						If you want a bar to track Holy Power, this one includes moving textures to account for  Divine Resonance and  Crusading Strikes:

						 Recommended Retribution Paladin Macros
					</h3>

					<p>
						Macros are simple, in-game tools which allow you to sequence spells together, create custom names and icons, cast different abilities depending on whether the target is friendly or hostile, define targeting conditions, and much, much more.

						For more information on creating macros, including full lists of conditionals, modifiers, and other command customizations you can use, check out our full Macros guide.
						Macros can often help make your life a bit easier when playing in a variety of situations. Here's some examples of how they can be used with Retribution abilities.
						 Focus Cast Macros
						If you need to interrupt one target while focusing damage on another, you can set it as your focus target and use this macro to interrupt it without having to manually swap targets to do so.
						
						Casts Rebuke on your focus, or on your target if you have no focus target:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@focus,harm,nodead] [] Rebuke
						 Targeted Macros
						
						AD
						
						Using [@@<player name here>], [@@targetoftarget] and similar modifiers can help you use your utility more easily if they're always going to be used on a specific player or role. Target of target macros can be useful for assisting your tanks.
						
						Casts  Blessing of Freedom on a set raid member:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@NAMEOFPLAYER] Blessing of Freedom
						Uses  Lay on Hands on your target's target:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@targettarget] Lay on Hands
						Alternatively, you can macro spells to target the player or enemy you're mousing over rather than the one you're targeting:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@mouseover] Blessing of Sacrifice
						 Final Reckoning Macros
						Instead of having to target the location of  Final Reckoning every time you cast it, you can have it automatically cast either on your character or at your cursor.
						
						Casts  Final Reckoning on top of your character:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@player] Final Reckoning
						Casts  Final Reckoning at your mouse cursor:
						#showtooltip
						/cast [@@cursor] Final Reckoning
					</p>

							 class="section-icon small-icon">
						 Recommended Retribution Paladin Addons
					</h3>

					<p>
					Addons are powerful tools that can customize your gameplay experience, ranging from graphical overlays, replacement action bars, and unit/raid frames to performance enhancements such as rotation helping spell reminders, buff/debuff tracking, popup reminders, and boss warnings. Here are some of the highly recommended and commonly used Retribution Paladin addons, which are certainly not required to play, but can go a long way toward increasing the information available to you in combat or simply make for a more pleasant viewing experience.
					</p>
					<p>
					Unlike Macros, managing Addons is done outside of the game, but our How to Install and Maintain Addons Guide will take you step-by-step through the process.
					</p>
					<p>
					Hekili: For players who are looking for a rotation helper, Hekili can be useful. It uses SimulationCraft priority lists to generate a guideline for your next button presses in the priority sequence.
					</p>	
					<p>
					BossMods: BossMods are addons that show you a timer of upcoming boss abilities and make noises if you stand in fire. You can choose between Deadly Boss Mods and BigWigs.
					</p>	
					<p>
					Damage meter: Skada or Details are the perfect addons to let you check the damage you and your raid member do. These addons are also useful to track interrupts, dispels or deaths.
					</p>
					<p>
					Download UI: If you don't want to make your own UI you can also download UI packages. The most common recommendation is to use ElvUI. ElvUI is a replacement for the standard Blizzard UI that is very easy to configure and a lot of high-end raiders are using. Check wago.io for profiles, or check out streamers on Twitch.
